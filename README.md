# Sales Data Analysis

## Dataset
I used a dataset collected from a project for the Introduction to Data Analytics Course 2023 for the [ReDI School of Digital Integration Malm√∂](https://www.redi-school.org/redi-school-malmo). Submitted by - Giorgia Faedda.

## Assignment instruction
### Objective: 
Apply your understanding of pandas by analyzing a small sales dataset. Use the skills you learned from the Grandma's Bakery example. Feel free to ask questions here if you encounter challenges or need clarification on more complex exercises.

### Dataset:
Save this as an Excel or CSV file. The dataset includes information about daily sales of products.

### Tasks:
1. **Import Data**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Explore the Data**: Display the first few rows, check for missing values, and provide basic information about the dataset. Add a new column to represent the total sales for each day in money.
3. **Calculate Total Sales**
4. **Calculate Total Quantity Sold**: Create a new column to represent the total quantity of products sold each day.
5. **Calculate Average Daily Sales**: Compute and display the average daily sales.
6. **Find Best and Worst Sales Days**: Identify the days with the highest and lowest total sales.
7. **Group by Month**: Group the data by month and calculate the total sales for each month.
8. **Ask a Question to ChatGPT**: Use ChatGPT to ask a question related to your data analysis. For example, you might ask for insights or suggestions for further analysis.

### Submission:
Submit your Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code for the tasks mentioned above. Include comments to explain your thought process and any challenges faced. Also, mention the response from ChatGPT and how it helped you in your analysis.
